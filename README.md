# Context

You are employed by a Swiss small/medium business making heavy use of information technology. Your boss is intrigued by cloud computing. He has read that it allows companies like yours to benefit from IT infrastructure that until recently only the big players, like Nestl√©, Novartis or UBS could afford.

Your boss asks that you investigate, in a small group of colleagues, a cloud service or cloud-related technology that could be of interest to your company. She wants you to prepare a presentation, for her and the product development team, that explains the service / technology. She also wants you to develop an application showing the benefits in a small proof-of-concept. You are asked to demo the proof-of-concept in the second part of your presentation.

# Instructions

Give a live [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fVJ9nNLJdK8AQp9xO-tru7vl4CVHA1s0coFc3Ml6qwA/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) of maximum `15 minutes` (theoretical part and demo of proof-of-concept). It will be followed by questions (3 minutes).
Deliver your slides `Monday June 9, 23:59` so that the professor can make it available to the class.

Explain globally your topic. Recall that your audience consists of application architects, developers and testers, but also business people (your boss). Don't forget to discuss cost and strategic questions.
- Be critical! Avoid repeating marketing claims ("enjoy the best developer experience").
- When discussing cost, invent a realistic cost scenario and give the monthly cost.
- Discuss the risk of vendor lock-in.

For the proof-of-concept choose a practical scenario relevant for a small/medium business that illustrates well the strengths and weaknesses of the cloud service/technology. (NB: This is not a mini-project, you are not asked to implement a functional application.)

Give general recommendations when it makes sense to use the cloud service / technology and when it doesn't.

Give pointers to references for further detailed information, explanations.

Write a short [document](./cheatsheet.md) (minimum 1 page) in the style of a "cheat sheet" for an engineer that explains
- what the cloud service/technology does and why it's interesting
- how to get started
- how to use it with the most important commands/operations
